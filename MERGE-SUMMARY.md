## 🔄 **Merge Instructions**

### **Step 1: Remove Old RFID System**

The old `rfid-system/` directory should be removed as it has been superseded by the new `rfid-platform/` implementation:

```bash
# Remove the old RFID system
rm -rf rfid-system/

# Verify removal
ls -la | grep rfid
```

### **Step 2: Add New RFID Platform**

Add all the new RFID platform files to git:

```bash
# Add all new files
git add .

# Check status
git status
```

### **Step 3: Commit Changes**

Commit all the changes with a comprehensive message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Implement production-grade RFID platform

- Complete enterprise-grade RFID tracking system
- Multi-tenant SaaS with org-level isolation
- Real-time processing with Redis Streams
- Partitioned database with 90-day retention
- HMAC authentication for device security
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline
- Full observability with OpenTelemetry
- Production-ready deployment automation

Features:
- API Gateway (FastAPI) with rate limiting
- Ingest Worker (Python) with deduplication
- Dashboard (Next.js 14) with real-time feeds
- Mobile App (Flutter) with offline sync

```

### **Step 4: Push to Main**

Push the changes to the main branch:

```bash
# Push to main branch
git push origin main

# If there are conflicts, resolve them first
git pull origin main
# Resolve any conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "resolve: Merge conflicts resolved"
git push origin main
```

## 🚀 **Post-Merge Actions**

### **1. Verify Deployment**

After the merge, verify that the new RFID platform is working:

```bash
